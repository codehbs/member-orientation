#CODE Member Orientation

Welcome! We're stoked that you're joining CODE at HBS. Our mission is to bring technologists together at HBS. Our meetings are a short 30 minutes each week, and we're focused on helping you make things. 

Before we start, let's get some administrative stuff out of the way.

## Become part of our commmunity
- [ ] Fill out your [member profile](http://bit.ly/codehbs-member-profiles)

- [ ] Request membership for [CODE's GitHub organization](http://github.com/codehbs) by emailing acoravos@mba2017.hbs.edu and providing your Github username. 

- [ ] Sign up for our [CODE Slack group](http://codehbs.slack.com) and add a channel for your accountability group if you have one

- [ ] Follow [@codeHBS](http://twitter.com/codehbs) on Twitter

## Pay your CODE dues
- [ ] Send membership dues of $35 (1 year) or $50 (2 years) to code@studentclubs.hbs.edu via PayPal's “Send money to friends and family”. In the “Note” box, please include (a) First and last name and (b) your HBS email address.
**Deadline**: The official HBS deadline has passed, but send a note to our CFO, Ben Cohen (bcohen@mba2017.hbs.edu), after you submit your PayPal dues and he will get you added to the club officially.

## Start Building
For those of you who are eager to jump in, here's a few ideas:
- [ ] Sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which has lots of great free and reduced-rates on developer tools for students. Some great benefits:
    - Free AWS, Digital Ocean, and Stripe credits (and many others)
    - Membership to Thinkful, including two weeks of one-on-one mentorship in Web Development
    - Free domain registration for a year
    - Unlimited private repositories on GitHub while you're a student
- [ ] Create your first PR for [CODE's open-source website](https://github.com/codehbs/codehbs-official-homepage). If you're not sure what a "PR" is or would like to work on this challenge with a friend, come to the next CODE meeting and we can parallel program and do it together :)

Welcome on board!
